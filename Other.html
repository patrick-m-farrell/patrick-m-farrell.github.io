        <h1>Other Types of Contrast</h1>
        There are other kinds of contrast, less clearly dependent on the type itself. Dair mentions
        "contrast by isolation," i.e., putting a word or phrase in an isolated position away from
        the other elements on the page, to make it stand out. (I think of this as a contrast of 
        position.) And he suggests other kinds of non-typographic contrast, such as mixing paper 
        stocks, embossing, and using contrasting matte or gloss inks. He also points out that 
        illustrations, especially line art, may be in harmony with the type on the same page or 
        may contrast with it completely.
        <p>Finally, Dair takes time to say a little about rhythm ("in typography, it consists of 
        intervals of space") and about the power of "interrupted rhythm" ("the impact derives
        not from the fact that the unexpected happens, but rather that the expected does not
        happen").</p>
        <p>Most of the time, we use more than one kind of contrast together, in order to make the 
            differences between visual elements even more obvious. We can use all of Dair's seven
            kinds of contrast at once, if we're skillful; he refers to this as typographic 
            "chords." (One of the chapter titles in "Design With Type" is "Multiplying the 
            Contrasts.") But breaking them down like this into simple oppositions makes it easier
             to use them consciously; it keeps us from getting our layouts all muddied up through
              trying to change too many things at once without thinking about what we're doing.
               I've found Carl Dair's analysis of typographic contrast—and especially the visual
                flair with which he presents it—an invaluable tool in the practice of graphic
                design.</p>
